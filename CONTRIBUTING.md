Feature requests are welcome. But take a moment to find out whether your idea fits with the scope and aims of the project. It's up to _you_ to make a strong case to convince me of the merits of this feature. Please provide as much detail and context as possible.

## Pull requests

Good pull requests, such as patches, improvements, and new features, are a fantastic help. They should remain focused in scope and avoid containing unrelated commits.

This will help ensure that your precious work is not in vain. Please ask first before embarking on any significant pull request (e.g. implementing features, refactoring code, porting to a different language). I'm happy to discuss your ideas.
